# Revisiting Node.js ‚Äî My Iterative Comeback

Hey, I‚Äôm **Pritom Biswas**. This repo is basically my Node.js revision log ‚Äî me re-walking through the basics, poking at the internals, and slowly stacking up to modern stuff: sockets, GraphQL, Prisma, and all that is intuitive.
Each folder here is either a tiny sandbox or a mini-workflow where I test the concepts. üòä

### 1. Hello\_World

**What it is:** A warm-up sandbox. Played with module exports, imports, and the CommonJS cache just to remind myself how Node actually attaches codes together. \
**Stack:** Pure Node core, CommonJS `require`, export tricks, console I/O.\
**Takeaway:** Before I let frameworks abstract everything, I want to know the main machines.

---

### 2. node\_server

**What it is:** Built servers two ways ‚Äî raw `http` vs Express ‚Äî to really *feel* the trade-off: control vs speed.\
**Stack:** Node‚Äôs `http` + `url`, some FS logging experiments, Express 5 routes/middleware.\
**Takeaway:** Use Express by choice, not ignorance.

---

### 3. project-01

**What it is:** My first structured REST API with CRUD verbs and MVC separation. Middleware became my new toy here.\
**Stack:** Express 5, custom middlewares (`logReqRes`), Mongoose for persistence, modular routes + controllers.\
**Takeaway:** Scaling chaos? Structure saves lives.

---

### 4. url\_shortener

**What it is:** Yep, built my own Bitly clone. IDs, redirects, auth ‚Äî the full utility vibe.\
**Stack:** Express 5, Mongoose, `nanoid` / `uuid`, EJS templating, JWT + cookies for auth.\
**Takeaway:** Storage + identity + UI = suddenly feels like a product. Also learned the difference between stateful and stateless methods.

---

### 5. discord-bot

**What it is:** A Discord bot that chats with AI. Basically, event-driven design + external API juggling.\
**Stack:** `discord.js`, OpenAI-compatible API, async streaming.\
**Takeaway:** Node shines at real-time + integration chaos.

---

### 6. sokcet\_chat

**What it is:** Real-time chat app demo. Socket.IO + Express. Added streams + compression on the side for fun.\
**Stack:** Express 5, `socket.io`, Node streams, gzip (`zlib`), tiny clustering hints.\
**Takeaway:** This is the jump from request/response into the reactive world.

---

### 7. blog

**What it is:** Classic blog backend: CRUD + auth + templates. JWTs join in here.\
**Stack:** Express 5, Mongoose, EJS, JWT, cookies, modular routes.\
**Takeaway:** Once you add identity, it stops being just endpoints and starts being a *platform*.

---

### 8. graphql

**What it is:** First taste of GraphQL. Hooked Apollo to Express, fetched JSONPlaceholder, resolved some nested fields.\
**Stack:** Apollo Server 4, Express 5 middleware, GraphQL SDL, resolvers, `axios` fetches.\
**Takeaway:** REST is asking for what‚Äôs cooked; GraphQL is cooking it your way. GraphQL does not magically makes the system efficient, but gives the client-side more freedom.

---

### 9. thread\_backend

**What it is:** More ‚Äúserious‚Äù backend skeleton ‚Äî like a Threads clone but modular, typed, and DB-backed.\
**Stack:** TypeScript, Apollo Server 4, Express 5, Prisma, PostgreSQL, modular schema, env configs.\
**Takeaway:** Type safety + schema-first + Prisma = the grown-up table.

## Running Themes

* From bare Node ‚Üí Express ‚Üí GraphQL.
* From memory ‚Üí Mongo (Mongoose) ‚Üí Postgres (Prisma).
* From stateless ‚Üí JWT/session identity.
* From sync scripts ‚Üí APIs ‚Üí sockets ‚Üí integrations.
* From ad-hoc files ‚Üí MVC ‚Üí typed modularity.

## Next Possible Moves

* The other 60% NodeJS is remaining üòä

## Closing Note

This repo is layered on purpose ‚Äî every project builds intuition first, then throws in abstraction. I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúbreadth without depth.‚Äù I want depth, repeated until it sticks. üöÄ

Explore, fork, remix, whatever. Always open to suggestions.
