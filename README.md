# Revisiting-Node

Hi, I am Pritom Biswas and I am revising the features of NodeJS ðŸ˜Š

## Here are the basic overview of the projects till now:

### 1. Hello_World:
Basics, file systems, imports, exports and some more ðŸ˜‰

### 2. node_server:
Basic request to the server. Consists both http module and express library oriented approach of sending requests

### 3. project-01:
Demonstrates the use of GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE headers. Also, demonstrates the use of middlewares (Belive me middlewares are the cores). Here I used MVC (models, view, controller) pattern for organizing my files.

### 4. url_shortener:
It is an url-shortener which first takes some url, then generates a short id (check nanoid package of Nodejs) and then makes a short url according to that id. When clicked on it, it redirects to the original URL. Simple but conceptual Project.

I am following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinedj3B30sDby4Al-i13hQJGQoRQDfPo 
Most of the projects are oriented to this.
