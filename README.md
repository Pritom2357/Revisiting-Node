# Revisiting-Node

Hi, I am Pritom Biswas and I am revising the features of NodeJS ðŸ˜Š

## Here are the basic overview of the projects till now:

### 1. Hello_World:
Basics, file systems, imports, exports and some more ðŸ˜‰

### 2. node_server:
Basic request to the server. Consists both http module and express library oriented approach of sending requests

### 3. project-01:
Demonstrates the use of GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE headers. Also, demonstrates the use of middlewares (Belive me middlewares are the cores)
